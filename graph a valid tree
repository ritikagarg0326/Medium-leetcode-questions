 Graph Valid Tree
Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n-1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to check whether these edges make up a valid tree.

Example 1:

Input: n = 5, and edges = [[0,1], [0,2], [0,3], [1,4]]
Output: true
Problem Explanation:
Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n-1 and a list of edges, the task is to determine whether the graph formed by these edges is a valid tree. A valid tree must satisfy two conditions:

The graph must be connected (all nodes are reachable from any other node).
The graph must be acyclic (it cannot have cycles).
Approach 1: Brute Force Solution (DFS/BFS)
Explanation:
Graph Representation: We can represent the graph using an adjacency list.
Cycle Detection: To ensure the graph is acyclic, we can perform a DFS or BFS to see if there are any back edges.
Connectedness Check: After ensuring no cycles, we need to check that all nodes are visited, ensuring the graph is connected.
Time Complexity:
Building the adjacency list takes 
𝑂
(
𝐸
)
O(E), where 
𝐸
E is the number of edges.
DFS/BFS traversal takes 
𝑂
(
𝑉
+
𝐸
)
O(V+E), where 
𝑉
V is the number of vertices (nodes).
Therefore, the total time complexity is 
𝑂
(
𝑉
+
𝐸
)
O(V+E).
Space Complexity:
The space complexity is 
𝑂
(
𝑉
+
𝐸
)
O(V+E) due to the adjacency list and the space used by the DFS recursion stack or BFS queue.
Approach 2: Optimized Solution (Union-Find)
Explanation:
Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union): This is a data structure that efficiently supports union and find operations. Using Union-Find, we can:
Cycle Detection: Check if adding an edge would create a cycle. If two nodes in an edge already belong to the same set, then adding the edge would create a cycle.
Connectedness Check: After processing all edges, there should be exactly n-1 edges for n nodes, and all nodes should be in the same connected component.
Time Complexity:
Union-Find operations (with path compression and union by rank) take nearly constant time, making the total time complexity 
𝑂
(
𝐸
⋅
𝛼
(
𝑉
)
)
O(E⋅α(V)), where 
𝛼
α is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows very slowly.
Space Complexity:
The space complexity is 
𝑂
(
𝑉
)
O(V) due to the space required by the Union-Find data structures.

Explanation of the Optimized Code:
Union-Find Class:

Initialization (__init__): We initialize the parent list, where each node is its own parent (self-loop), and the rank list to manage tree height during union operations.

Find Function: This function returns the root of a node using path compression, which flattens the tree to ensure future queries are faster.

Union Function: This function unites two sets. If two nodes are already connected (i.e., they have the same root), adding another edge between them would create a cycle, and we return False. Otherwise, we unite them by rank and return True.

Valid Tree Check:

We first check if the number of edges is exactly n-1, as this is a necessary condition for a valid tree.
For each edge, we attempt to unite the nodes. If at any point the union operation returns False, a cycle is detected, and we return False.
If all edges are processed without detecting a cycle, the graph is a valid tree.
Brute Force Approach (DFS/BFS Cycle Detection and Connectedness Check):
python
Copy code
from collections import defaultdict

def dfs(node, parent, graph, visited):
    # Mark the current node as visited
    visited.add(node)
    
    # Visit all neighbors
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if neighbor == parent:
            continue
        if neighbor in visited:
            return False  # Cycle detected
        if not dfs(neighbor, node, graph, visited):
            return False
    
    return True

Time and Space Complexity:

α is the inverse Ackermann function, which is very close to constant time.
Space Complexity:

Example Execution:

Is valid tree: True
Brute force - Is valid tree: True
Conclusion:
The Union-Find solution is an efficient way to check for cycles and connectedness in the graph with time complexity close to linear.
The DFS/BFS approach is conceptually simpler but might not perform as efficiently for large graphs due to the recursive depth and need for adjacency lists. Both methods effectively solve the problem within their respective trade-offs.
