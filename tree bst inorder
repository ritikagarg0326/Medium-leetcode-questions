Problem Understanding:
Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST) and an integer k, we need to return the k-th smallest value from the tree. In a BST, for any node, the left subtree contains nodes with values less than the node, and the right subtree contains nodes with values greater than the node.

Brute Force Solution:
To solve this problem using brute force, we can perform an inorder traversal of the BST. Inorder traversal of a BST gives the nodes in sorted order. Once we have the sorted list of node values, we simply return the k-th smallest value, which will be the k-1 index in the sorted list (since it's 1-indexed).

Steps:
Perform Inorder Traversal: Traverse the tree in inorder fashion (left subtree → root → right subtree). This will give us the nodes in ascending order.
Return the k-th Smallest: After the inorder traversal, we can directly access the k-1 index of the sorted list and return it.
Time Complexity:
O(n): We are traversing the entire tree, where n is the number of nodes.
Space Complexity:
O(n): We are storing the inorder traversal result in a list, which requires space for n nodes.
Optimized Solution (In-Place Inorder Traversal):
To improve space complexity, we can avoid storing the entire inorder traversal list and instead find the k-th smallest element directly during the traversal. We perform an in-order traversal, but stop as soon as we've visited the k-th smallest element.

Steps:
Inorder Traversal with Early Stopping: We perform a modified inorder traversal where we count the number of nodes visited. Once we reach the k-th node, we stop and return its value.
This avoids storing the entire traversal, reducing the space complexity.
Time Complexity:
O(n) in the worst case, where n is the number of nodes (if k is the last element).
Space Complexity:
O(h), where h is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursion stack in an in-order traversal, which requires space proportional to the height of the tree.
Brute Force Code:

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def kthSmallestBruteForce(root, k):
    # Helper function for inorder traversal
    def inorder(node):
        if not node:
            return []
        # Traverse left subtree, then current node, then right subtree
        return inorder(node.left) + [node.val] + inorder(node.right)
    
    # Perform inorder traversal to get sorted values
    inorder_list = inorder(root)
    
    # Return the k-th smallest (1-indexed, hence k-1 for 0-indexing)
    return inorder_list[k-1]

# Example usage
root = TreeNode(3)
root.left = TreeNode(1)
root.right = TreeNode(4)
root.left.right = TreeNode(2)
k = 1
print(kthSmallestBruteForce(root, k))  # Output: 1

    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def kthSmallestOptimized(root, k):
    # Initialize variables to keep track of count and result
    count = 0
    result = None

    # Helper function for in-place inorder traversal
    def inorder(node):
        nonlocal count, result
        if not node or result is not None:
            return
        
        # Traverse the left subtree
        inorder(node.left)
        
        # Process the current node
        count += 1
        if count == k:
            result = node.val
            return
        
        # Traverse the right subtree
        inorder(node.right)
    
    # Perform inorder traversal
    inorder(root)
    
    return result

# Example usage
root = TreeNode(5)
root.left = TreeNode(3)
root.right = TreeNode(6)
root.left.left = TreeNode(2)
root.left.right = TreeNode(4)
root.left.left.left = TreeNode(1)
k = 3
print(kthSmallestOptimized(root, k))  # Output: 3
Explanation of Optimized Solution:
Helper Function (inorder):

It performs an inorder traversal (left → root → right).
We maintain a count of visited nodes. Once count == k, we set result to the current node's value and stop further traversal.
nonlocal keyword is used to modify count and result variables in the outer function scope.
Time Complexity:

In the worst case, we still might need to visit every node, so the time complexity remains O(n).
Space Complexity:

The space complexity is reduced to O(h), where h is the height of the tree (due to recursion stack space).
Comparison:
Approach	Time Complexity	Space Complexity	Explanation
Brute Force	O(n)	O(n)	Stores the entire inorder traversal result in a list.
Optimized (In-place Inorder)	O(n)	O(h)	Does not store the result, uses recursion stack space proportional to tree height.
The optimized solution reduces space complexity by not storing the entire traversal and is preferred when handling large trees or memory constraints.
