Minimum Limit of Balls in a Bag

You are given an integer array nums where the ith bag contains nums[i] balls. You are also given an integer maxOperations.

You can perform the following operation at most maxOperations times:

Take any bag of balls and divide it into two new bags with a positive number of balls.
For example, a bag of 5 balls can become two new bags of 1 and 4 balls, or two new bags of 2 and 3 balls.
Your penalty is the maximum number of balls in a bag. You want to minimize your penalty after the operations.

Return the minimum possible penalty after performing the operations.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [9], maxOperations = 2
Output: 3
Problem Explanation:
You are given an array nums where each element represents the number of balls in a bag. You are also given maxOperations, which indicates the maximum number of operations allowed. In each operation, you can divide any bag of balls into two bags. The objective is to minimize the penalty, which is defined as the maximum number of balls in any bag after performing at most maxOperations operations.

Approach:
The brute force approach would try dividing the bags in all possible ways and calculate the penalty after each set of operations. However, this approach is highly inefficient and impractical because there can be many ways to divide the balls and perform the operations.

An optimized approach uses binary search on the potential penalty. The idea is to minimize the largest number of balls in any bag. We can perform binary search on the range from 1 (the minimum possible penalty) to the maximum number of balls in the largest bag. For each middle value in the binary search, we simulate the process and check if we can achieve that penalty with the given maxOperations.

Optimized Solution (Binary Search):
The optimized approach involves using binary search to find the minimum penalty. Here's the step-by-step process:

Binary Search Setup:

The left boundary (left) is set to 1 (minimum possible penalty).
The right boundary (right) is set to the maximum number of balls in any bag (max(nums)).
Binary Search:

For each middle value (mid), we check if it is possible to achieve a maximum penalty of mid after at most maxOperations. This is done by simulating the number of operations needed to ensure that no bag contains more than mid balls.
Operations Count:

For each bag of size n, we calculate how many splits are required to reduce the size of the largest bag to mid or less. The number of operations required for a bag of size n to be reduced to size mid or less is (n - 1) // mid.
Terminate the Search:

If the number of operations is less than or equal to maxOperations, we move to the left half to try smaller penalties.
Otherwise, we move to the right half to increase the allowed penalty.

        if num > penalty:
            operations += (num - 1) // penalty
            if operations > maxOperations:
                return False
    return True

def minimumPenalty(nums, maxOperations):
    left, right = 1, max(nums)
    
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if canAchievePenalty(nums, maxOperations, mid):
            right = mid  # Try for a smaller penalty
        else:
            left = mid + 1  # Increase penalty to make it achievable
    
    return left

# Example Input
nums = [9]
maxOperations = 2

# Output
print(minimumPenalty(nums, maxOperations))  # Output: 3
Explanation of the Optimized Solution:
canAchievePenalty Function:

This function checks if we can achieve a given penalty (mid) with the allowed number of operations.
For each bag, if its size is greater than the penalty, we calculate how many operations are needed to split it such that no part exceeds the penalty.
If the total operations exceed maxOperations, return False. Otherwise, return True.
Binary Search:

We perform binary search to minimize the penalty. The search space is the range of penalties from 1 to the maximum number of balls in the largest bag.
For each middle value, we check if it's possible to achieve that penalty using the canAchievePenalty function.
Final Result:

The binary search continues until the left pointer converges with right, giving us the minimum possible penalty.

Explanation of Input/Output:
Example 1:
Input: nums = [9], maxOperations = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: After dividing the 9-ball bag into two bags of sizes [6,3] and then dividing the 6-ball bag into two bags of sizes [3,3], the largest bag has 3 balls, which is the minimized penalty.
Brute Force Solution:
In the brute force approach, we would try all possible penalties starting from 1 to max(nums) and check if we can achieve each one within maxOperations. This approach is highly inefficient and would take a lot of time for larger inputs, so binary search is much better suited for this problem.

Brute Force Code:

def canAchievePenaltyBrute(nums, maxOperations, penalty):
    operations = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num > penalty:
            operations += (num - 1) // penalty
            if operations > maxOperations:
                return False
    return True

def minimumPenaltyBruteForce(nums, maxOperations):
    for penalty in range(1, max(nums) + 1):
        if canAchievePenaltyBrute(nums, maxOperations, penalty):
            return penalty

# Example Input
nums = [9]
maxOperations = 2

# Output
print(minimumPenaltyBruteForce(nums, maxOperations))  # Output: 3
Brute Force Time Complexity:

The binary search solution is optimal for this problem and reduces the time complexity significantly compared to the brute force solution.
