You are given an integer array nums. Two players are playing a game with this array: player 1 and player 2.

Player 1 and player 2 take turns, with player 1 starting first. Both players start the game with a score of 0. At each turn, the player takes one of the numbers from either end of the array (i.e., nums[0] or nums[nums.length - 1]) which reduces the size of the array by 1. The player adds the chosen number to their score. The game ends when there are no more elements in the array.

Return true if Player 1 can win the game. If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner, and you should also return true. You may assume that both players are playing optimally.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,5,2]
Output: false
Explanation: Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2. 
If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2). 
So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5. 
Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return false.
  To solve the "Predict the Winner" problem, we will use a dynamic programming approach, which is well-suited for problems involving game theory and optimal strategies.

Problem Breakdown
Game Rules:

Players can pick numbers from either end of the array.
Players aim to maximize their score while minimizing their opponent's score.
Player 1 wins if their score is greater than or equal to Player 2's score.
Optimal Strategy:

Since both players play optimally, we need to determine if Player 1 can guarantee a win based on the scores they can achieve from the given choices.
Approach
We can use a dynamic programming (DP) approach to keep track of the maximum score Player 1 can achieve over Player 2 for every possible subarray defined by its start and end indices.

DP Table Definition:

Let dp[i][j] represent the maximum score Player 1 can achieve over Player 2 from the subarray nums[i] to nums[j].
Recurrence Relation:

When Player 1 chooses nums[i], Player 2 will play optimally and choose the maximum of the two remaining options:

)
dp[i][j]=max(nums[i]‚àídp[i+1][j],nums[j]‚àídp[i][j‚àí1])
The base case occurs when there's only one number:

ùëõ

ùëñ
]
dp[i][i]=nums[i]
Final Decision:

Player 1 can guarantee a win if dp[0][n - 1] >= 0, where n is the length of the nums array.
Time and Space Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n¬≤), where 
ùëõ
n is the length of the input array. This is due to filling out the DP table.
Space Complexity: O(n¬≤) as we need a 2D table for DP.
Brute Force Solution
The brute force approach would recursively explore all possible choices for both players, calculating scores without memoization, which is not efficient for larger inputs.

Brute Force Code Implementation
python
Copy code
def canWin(nums):
    """Brute force solution to determine if Player 1 can win."""
    def score(start, end):
        # Base case: when there's only one element
        if start == end:
            return nums[start]
        
        # Player 1's score if they take nums[start] or nums[end]
        return max(nums[start] - score(start + 1, end), nums[end] - score(start, end - 1))

    return score(0, len(nums) - 1) >= 0

# Example usage
nums = [1, 5, 2]
print(canWin(nums))  # Output: False
Optimized Solution
Now, let's implement the dynamic programming solution based on the approach we discussed.

Optimized Code Implementation
python
Copy code
def PredictTheWinner(nums):
    """Optimized solution to determine if Player 1 can win using dynamic programming."""
    n = len(nums)
    
    # Create a 2D DP array
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Base case: when there's only one element
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i][i] = nums[i]
    
    # Fill the DP table
    for length in range(2, n + 1):  # length of the subarray
        for start in range(n - length + 1):
            end = start + length - 1
            dp[start][end] = max(nums[start] - dp[start + 1][end], nums[end] - dp[start][end - 1])
    
    # Player 1 can win if their score is non-negative
    return dp[0][n - 1] >= 0

# Example usage
nums = [1, 5, 233, 7]
print(PredictTheWinner(nums))  # Output: True
Explanation of the Optimized Code
Initialization: We initialize a 2D list dp where dp[i][j] stores the maximum score difference Player 1 can achieve over Player 2 when playing optimally on the subarray nums[i] to nums[j].

Base Case: When start equals end, the only choice for Player 1 is to take nums[i], hence dp[i][i] = nums[i].

Filling the DP Table:

We iterate over all possible lengths of subarrays from 2 to 
ùëõ
n.
For each subarray defined by start and end, we calculate the best score Player 1 can guarantee by choosing either the leftmost or the rightmost number.
Final Result: The decision to return whether Player 1 can win is based on whether dp[0][n-1] is non-negative.

Summary of Comparison
Approach	Time Complexity	Space Complexity	Explanation

Optimized	O(n¬≤)	O(n¬≤)	Uses dynamic programming to minimize recomputation.
The optimized solution is significantly more efficient and should be used for larger inputs.
