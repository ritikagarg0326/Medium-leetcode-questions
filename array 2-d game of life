The board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the m x n grid board, return the next state.

 

Brute Force Approach:
The brute force approach would involve making a deep copy of the board, and for each cell, count its neighbors' states from the original board and apply the rules to update the copy.

Steps:
Deep copy the board to avoid altering the original board during computation.
For each cell, check the states of its eight neighbors.
Apply the rules for live or dead cells based on the neighbor counts.
Update the new board based on the results.
Time Complexity:
O(m * n): We iterate over all cells in the grid, and for each cell, we check its eight neighbors.
Space Complexity:
O(m * n): A copy of the board is used to store the next state.
Brute Force Code:

def gameOfLifeBruteForce(board):
    # Get dimensions of the board
    m, n = len(board), len(board[0])
    
    # Create a deep copy of the board to store the new state
    new_board = [[board[i][j] for j in range(n)] for i in range(m)]
    
    # Helper function to count live neighbors
    def count_live_neighbors(x, y):
        live_neighbors = 0
        # List of all 8 possible directions
        directions = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < m and 0 <= ny < n and board[nx][ny] == 1:
                live_neighbors += 1
        return live_neighbors
    
    # Update the new board based on the game rules
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            live_neighbors = count_live_neighbors(i, j)
            if board[i][j] == 1:  # live cell
                if live_neighbors < 2 or live_neighbors > 3:
                    new_board[i][j] = 0  # cell dies
            else:  # dead cell
                if live_neighbors == 3:
                    new_board[i][j] = 1  # cell becomes alive
    
    return new_board

# Example usage
board = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0]]
print(gameOfLifeBruteForce(board))  # Output: [[0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]]
Optimized Solution (In-Place):
To optimize this, we can avoid using additional space by updating the board in-place. However, we need to avoid altering values prematurely. To do this, we can use two additional states:

Use 2 to mark cells that were live and are going to die.
Use -1 to mark cells that were dead and are going to come to life.
This way, we can distinguish the previous state of each cell even as we update the board.

Steps:
For each cell, check its neighbors and decide if it will change state using temporary markers (2 and -1).
After processing all cells, update the board by converting 2 -> 0 and -1 -> 1.
Time Complexity:
O(m * n): We still visit every cell and check its neighbors.
Space Complexity:
O(1): We only use a few additional variables, modifying the board in place.
Optimized Code (In-Place):

    m, n = len(board), len(board[0])
    
    # Helper function to count live neighbors
    def count_live_neighbors(x, y):
        live_neighbors = 0
        directions = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < m and 0 <= ny < n and abs(board[nx][ny]) == 1:
                live_neighbors += 1
        return live_neighbors
    
    # First pass: mark the cells with temporary states
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            live_neighbors = count_live_neighbors(i, j)
            if board[i][j] == 1:  # live cell
                if live_neighbors < 2 or live_neighbors > 3:
                    board[i][j] = 2  # Mark live cell going to die
            else:  # dead cell
                if live_neighbors == 3:
                    board[i][j] = -1  # Mark dead cell going to live
    
    # Second pass: update the board with final states
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if board[i][j] == 2:
                board[i][j] = 0  # Cell dies
            elif board[i][j] == -1:
                board[i][j] = 1  # Cell becomes alive

# Example usage
board = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0]]
gameOfLife(board)
print(board)  # Output: [[0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]]
Explanation of Optimized Solution:
In-Place Updates:

Cells are updated in-place without needing an additional board.
We use two extra values: 2 for cells that were live and will die, and -1 for cells that were dead and will become alive.
Counting Live Neighbors:

The function count_live_neighbors counts live neighbors for each cell.
We use abs(board[x][y]) to handle both original live cells (1) and cells marked with 2 (live cells going to die), ensuring we only count cells that were originally live.
Two-Pass Update:

In the first pass, we mark cells with 2 or -1 based on the current state and the number of live neighbors.
In the second pass, we finalize the board by converting 2 -> 0 and -1 -> 1.
Handling Infinite Grids:
If the grid is infinite, the problem becomes more complex as we can't handle boundaries directly. One possible approach would be to dynamically expand the grid or focus only on a finite active region where changes occur. For example, we could:

Track the bounding box of live cells and only compute the next state within this region.
Dynamically expand the grid if live cells reach the current boundary.
In practice, the problem usually assumes a finite grid, so we don't need to handle the infinite case directly unless specified.

Comparison:
Approach	Time Complexity	Space Complexity	Explanation
Brute Force	O(m * n)	O(m * n)	Uses a separate copy of the board to compute updates.
Optimized (In-Place)	O(m * n)	O(1)	Updates the board in-place using temporary markers.
The in-place approach is much more space-efficient and is preferred for larger grids or constrained environments.
